SPARK
From Spark to Ship
Full App Development Plan — AI Council Edition



Version 1.0  |  Target Launch: Month 3  |  Budget: ₹0
Platforms: iOS & Android  |  Framework: React Native + Expo

0. Executive Summary
SPARK is an agentic mobile app that captures your ideas and does all the heavy lifting — researching them, breaking them into actionable tasks, and scheduling those tasks into your calendar automatically. It runs background AI agents that work even when the app is closed, pushing a notification when the work is done. Built entirely on free-tier services until revenue justifies cost.

▸ The Core Promise to Users
"You type your idea. SPARK handles the research, the planning, and the scheduling — then taps your shoulder when it's ready."

Target audience: Students, young professionals, and aspiring founders aged 18–28.
Primary markets: India (Android-first), then global.


1. Product Features (What We Are Building)
1.1 Core Features — v1 (Must Ship)
A. Idea Capture
	•	Text input with long-form support for full idea descriptions
	•	Voice-to-text input using Expo Speech API (free, on-device)
	•	Idea saved immediately offline (WatermelonDB) and synced to Supabase when online
	•	Category tagging: App, Business, Content, Side Project, Research, Other
B. Research Agent
	•	Triggered automatically when user submits an idea
	•	Runs entirely on the server — app does not need to be open
	•	Generates 5 targeted search queries from the idea text using an LLM
	•	Executes searches using Tavily Search API (1,000 free calls/month)
	•	Synthesizes results into structured output:
	•	Concept summary (2–3 paragraphs)
	•	Recommended tech stack or tools/resources required
	•	Step-by-step process (broken into phases)
	•	Estimated time per phase
	•	5–8 curated resource links (articles, docs, videos)
	•	Common mistakes to avoid
	•	Pushes a notification when research is complete: "Your SPARK for [Idea Name] is ready"
C. Scheduler Agent
	•	After the user reviews research and hits "Schedule It", this agent activates
	•	First asks the user: preferred working days and time windows (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri, 7–9 PM)
	•	Reads available calendar slots via OAuth APIs (Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar)
	•	Breaks every step into atomic same-day tasks — no task spans two days
	•	Each task is scoped to 30–90 minutes so it is completable in a single session
	•	Writes scheduled task events directly to the user's connected calendar
	•	Event description contains full context: what to do, why, and a link back into SPARK
	•	Pushes confirmation notification: "14 tasks scheduled. Your first session is Tuesday at 7 PM"
D. Task Tracking & Rescheduling
	•	Main "Active Projects" screen shows all in-progress ideas and their task completion %
	•	Task list view shows all upcoming sessions for an idea in chronological order
	•	Push notification arrives 30 minutes before each scheduled task session (like an alarm)
	•	Notification has two action buttons: "I'm on it" (dismiss) and "Reschedule" (inline)
	•	Rescheduling via notification: opens a bottom sheet to pick a new date/time slot
	•	Reschedule propagates to connected calendar automatically
	•	Tasks marked Done from within app or from notification — calendar event updated accordingly
E. Streak & Momentum Tracker
	•	GitHub-style heatmap showing daily task completion history
	•	Current streak count in days (resets if no task completed for 24+ hours)
	•	Momentum Score: composite of streak + completion rate + idea count — displayed as a number
	•	"Rescue Notification": if 48 hours pass with no activity, agent finds the smallest task in any active project and pushes: "You have 20 minutes? This one task will keep your streak alive"
F. Dig-Deeper Agent (On-Demand)
	•	In any research output, user can tap any section or bullet and ask "Tell me more"
	•	A focused research agent runs a targeted deep dive on that specific subtopic
	•	Response streams in real-time — user sees text appearing live (like ChatGPT)
	•	Follow-up questions supported in a chat thread below the main research

1.2 Phase 2 Features — After Launch
G. Enhancement Agent (Triggers at 40% Completion)
	•	When 40% of tasks for any idea are marked Done, this agent runs automatically
	•	Re-researches the idea with updated context: "What enhancements should this project have?"
	•	Delivers a push notification: "Your project is taking shape — here are 5 enhancements to consider"
	•	UI switches from "Idea" to "Project" labelling at this milestone — a deliberate psychological shift
H. Idea Aging System
	•	"Dormant" state: idea not scheduled or worked on for 14 days
	•	Gentle push at Day 14: "This idea is sleeping. Wake it up?"
	•	"Archived" state at Day 30 with prompt: delete, restart, or share with a friend (referral mechanic)
I. Idea Collision
	•	Once user has 3+ dormant ideas, agent surfaces two and asks: "What if these two combined?"
	•	Generates a hybrid concept brief — a creative prompt to spark new momentum
J. Vibe Code Ready Export
	•	One-tap export of a fully structured PRD (Product Requirements Document)
	•	Includes a Cursor/Bolt/Lovable-ready system prompt to immediately start AI coding
	•	Exports as Notion page, markdown file, or shared link
K. Integrations (Phase 2)
	•	Notion: sync idea research output as a Notion page
	•	Google Tasks / Microsoft To Do: sync task list into these apps
	•	Apple Calendar (CalDAV): same scheduling flow as Google/Microsoft

3. System Architecture
3.1 High-Level Data Flow
The entire system is event-driven. Every action in the app fires an event that the backend processes asynchronously. The app never waits for agent work — it submits and gets notified when complete.

▸ Idea Research Flow (Step by Step)
1. User types idea in app → saved to WatermelonDB instantly (offline safe)
2. App sends POST to Cloudflare Worker: { userId, ideaId, ideaText }
3. Worker validates auth (Supabase JWT), inserts idea into Supabase DB, fires Inngest event: "idea.submitted"
4. Inngest picks up event, runs Research Agent function (server-side):
     a. LLM call #1: Generate 5 search queries from idea text
     b. Tavily API: Execute all 5 searches in parallel
     c. LLM call #2: Synthesize search results into structured JSON (summary, steps, stack, resources)
     d. Write structured output to Supabase research_results table
     e. Supabase Realtime broadcasts update → app shows result live if open
     f. Inngest triggers push notification via Expo Push API
5. User receives notification. Taps → app opens to full research output.

▸ Scheduling Flow (Step by Step)
1. User reviews research, taps "Schedule It"
2. Onboarding sheet: "Which days can you work? What times work best?"
3. App prompts OAuth consent for Google/Microsoft Calendar (first time only)
4. App sends POST to Cloudflare Worker with: userId, ideaId, preferences, calendarTokens
5. Inngest event: "idea.schedule_requested"
6. Scheduler Agent runs:
     a. Calls Google/Microsoft Calendar API to read free/busy slots for next 4 weeks
     b. LLM breaks research steps into atomic same-day tasks (30–90 min each)
     c. Assigns tasks to available slots respecting user preferences
     d. Writes events to calendar via API (includes deep-link back to app)
     e. Saves schedule to Supabase tasks table
7. Notification: "14 tasks scheduled. First session: Tuesday, 7 PM"

4. UX Design Guidelines
4.1 Core Design Principles
	•	Dark theme by default — target users work late nights on ideas
	•	Each idea gets a unique color accent so the app feels personal, not generic
	•	The app should feel like a thinking partner, not a task manager
	•	Status of agents must be visible at all times — "Spark is researching your idea..." with a live indicator
	•	Every screen accessible in 2 taps maximum from the home screen

4.3 Key Interaction Details
Idea Card Design (Home Screen)
	•	Card shows: idea title, category badge, status chip (Researching / Ready / Scheduled / In Progress / Dormant)
	•	Active agent: card has a pulsing glow border in the idea's accent color
	•	Swipe left on card: archive / delete options
	•	Swipe right: quick-mark top task as Done
Research Output Design (Idea Detail Screen)
	•	Research text streams in with a typewriter animation when first loaded
	•	Sections are collapsible accordions: Summary, Steps, Tech Stack, Resources, Mistakes to Avoid
	•	Each bullet in Steps section is tappable → opens Dig-Deeper agent inline
	•	Sticky bottom bar: "Schedule It" button + estimated total time badge
Push Notification Design
	•	Rich notification with app icon and idea title in header
	•	Body: single clear sentence about what's ready or what's due
	•	Action buttons: 2 max per notification (e.g., "View" + "Reschedule" OR "Done" + "Skip")
	•	Tapping notification body: deep links directly into the relevant screen in app

9. Go-to-Market Strategy (₹0 Budget)
9.1 Pre-Launch (Month 1–2)
	•	Build in public on Twitter/X and LinkedIn — post weekly updates: "Building SPARK, day 14: the research agent just worked for the first time"
	•	Create a waitlist landing page on Notion (free) or Carrd (free) — collect emails before launch
	•	Post in relevant communities: r/IndiaStartups, r/Entrepreneur, r/reactnative, IndiaHacks Discord
	•	Share the idea with 10 people in your college — get 5 to commit to being beta users
	•	Document the build journey as a thread series — "Building a ₹0 AI app" performs very well on LinkedIn in India
9.2 Launch (Month 3)
	•	ProductHunt launch: prepare assets 2 weeks early. Launch on a Tuesday–Thursday for best visibility
	•	Post on r/Apple, r/Android, r/productivity, r/nocode, r/vibe_coding on launch day
	•	Direct DM 20 tech YouTubers/creators in India (size: 10k–100k subscribers) — offer free Pro access for an honest review
	•	Post in college WhatsApp/Telegram groups — "I built an app to help you actually execute your ideas"
	•	Email the waitlist collected in pre-launch phase
9.3 Growth (Month 4+)
	•	Referral mechanic: "Share your dormant idea with a friend — they get 1 free research run"
	•	Build streak sharing — "I've been building for 14 days straight with SPARK 🔥" as a share card
	•	Apply to startup accelerators: NASSCOM, T-Hub, IIT incubators — free mentorship + credibility
	•	Cold email 10 college entrepreneurship cells to use SPARK in their idea competitions

10. Council Sign-Off & First Action Items
10.1 The Council's 3 Non-Negotiables
▸ Agent A (Developer):
Do NOT build a custom backend server. Supabase + Cloudflare Workers + Inngest handles everything. A custom Node.js server will drain your time and cost money. Stay serverless until 500k+ users.

▸ Agent C (Architect):
Do NOT use LangChain or complex agent frameworks. Write your 4 agents as simple async functions that call APIs directly. You can always add complexity later — you cannot remove it.

▸ Agent D (TPM):
Ship an imperfect v1 by end of Month 1 to 5 real users. Real user feedback is worth 100x any planning document. The plan changes the moment it meets users — and that's good.
